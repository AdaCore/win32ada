   --  This package describes the differences in machine
   --  architectures that need to be known by Stdarg.
   --
   --  I386 is Intel 386/486/Pentium PC's
   --  Sparc is Sun-4 Sparcstation and Sparcserver
   --  HP is Hewlett-Packard HP-9000 series 700 and 800
   --  Mips is machines based on the MIPS chip, such as SGI
   --  PowerPC is Apple-IBM-Motorola Power PC, and IBM RS / 6000
   --  Alpha is the Digital Equipment Corporation chip.
   --
   --  To build these packages for a different architecture,
   --  change the constant This_Arch to one of the allowed values
   --  and recompile.
